1) Create a Python3 virtual environment and activate. 
Please check documentations for different OSs such as Linux, Mac, Windows as necessary to create YOUR own virtual env.
2) Install the required python modules in the virtual environment (It will be evident from the solo and simple code file to understand which modules to install. 
I am NOT providing any requirements.txt for easy installation)
3) Create a "reports" dirctory where YOU want to save test reports
4) Execute the following from command line in the virtual env:
$pytest --html=./reports/xreport.html test_code/test_draft.py

When executing the above command, please take care of YOUR own directory structure in YOUR virtual environment. 
If YOU find any issue, please do G-search and debug.
